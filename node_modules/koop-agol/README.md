# koop-agol

## An ArcGIS online provider to [Koop](https://github.com/Esri/koop) 

To install in an existing Koop deploy and register ArcGIS Online:

```bash
cd koop
npm install https://github.com/chelm/koop-agol/tarball/master
node server.js

curl -i -X POST -d "id=arcgis" -d "host=https://www.arcgis.com" "http://localhost:1337/agol/register"
```

## Installation for local development 
1. clone the repo
   ```git clone git@github.com:Esri/koop-agol.git```
2. enter the koop project directory 
    ```cd koop-agol```
3. install the node.js dependencies
    ```npm install```
4. run the tests
    ```npm test``` 

## Installing within a Koop instance 

Koop by default will not install any providers. Each provider (like this one) must be installed individually. 

Within a Koop instance you can use npm install to install a provider: 
  ```npm install https://github.com/Esri/koop-agol/tarball/master```

This will install the latest code from the github repo into Koop. When the Koop server is started the provider, and its routes/endpoints, will automatically be booted into Koop.
